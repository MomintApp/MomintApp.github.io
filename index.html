    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application, Momint.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        We collect your Ethereum address so that you can mint your NFTs into your own account. We are not able to access your personal identity through your Ethereum address unless you publically display this information yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2. Photos</h3>
    <p>
        Our app allows you to take photos within the app to create NFTs. These photos are stored locally on your device and are also uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized storage network. The photos are also minted as NFTs, and some metadata may be carried through the images and stored on a blockchain.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        We use your Ethereum address for the purpose of allowing you to mint the NFTs into your own account. We do not share, sell, or disclose this information to third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2. Photos</h3>
    <p>
        The photos you take within the app are used solely for the purpose of creating NFTs. We store these photos on IPFS to ensure their availability and integrity. We do not access or use these photos for any other purposes, and we do not share them with third parties unless required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information and photos you provide through our app. We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
        Our app may integrate with third-party services or platforms, including IPFS, that have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for information on how they collect, use, and disclose your information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy within the app. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for any updates.
    </p>
